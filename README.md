# Machine learning Model to predict the Failure of Machine parts

# Overview
A manufacturing company decides to invest in proactive maintenance methods to reduce expensive unexpected breakdowns.In the maintenance process, asset's health, status, and performance in real time are tracked. Based on the tracked details, build a model to predict failure of machine parts.The main task is to create a predictive model that can determine whether the machine will fail and if it is failing then what type of Failure .

# Software Environment
* Python 
* numpy 
* scipy	
* matplotlib 
* scikit-learn 
* pandas

# Data Summary
The dataset predictive_maintenance.xlsx consists of 10,000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns.
