# Machine learning Model to predict the Failure of Machine parts

# Overview
A manufacturing company decides to invest in proactive maintenance methods to reduce expensive unexpected breakdowns.In the maintenance process, asset's health, status, and performance in real time are tracked. Based on the tracked details, build a model to predict failure of machine parts.The main task is to create a predictive model that can determine whether the machine will fail and if it is failing then what type of Failure .
